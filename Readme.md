> WARNING:
> Didn't follow the given headers for more flexibility.
> But all containers are implemented as expected complexity.

###Array
Implemented using *normal Array*.
Complexity:
all supported operation : Constant

###List

Implemented using *bi-directional linked list*.
Complexity:
Get/Put the First/Last element : Constant
Search: O(n)
Insert & Remove: Constant(Given Node)
Iteration: O(n)
Clear: O(n)

###Stack & Queue
Implemented using List

###Vector
Implemented using *dynamic allocated Array*.
Complexity:
Get: Constant
Put: Average Constant
Other Operations:O(n)

###Priority Queue
Implemented using *heap*.
Complexity:
O(logN)

###Unordered Map
Implemented using *hash table*.

Complexity:
<=O(n/MaxArrayLength)
> the MaxArrayLength depends on your hash function.
> Warning:No default hash functions are given.
